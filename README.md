# UFOs (using Javascript programming language, HTML, CSS/BOOTTRAP)

## Overview of Project

This project creates a webpage to visualize the data about UFO sightings. The data contained within the javascript file includes an abundance of information regarding UFO sightings, such as the country, city, and state of where sightings have been reported, as well as dates and type of sightings.

In order to vizualize and filter the data, a html file is used to create a webpage with a dynamic table. The dynambic table  can be utilized to filter the data via mutliple search criteria.

### Results

The dymanic table created allow you to filter data by date, city, state, country and shape.

To conduct a search first input your search criteria within any of the input boxes using the same format as the pre-filled placdholder text. Once you fill in the search box your table will automatically return data base on the search criteria used. 

* Example search by date

#### Summary

This webage is good start in shifting through the data based  on certain criteria but doesn't allow for any type of analysis such as frequency of sightings in a paticular location. I would recommend adding charts to vizualizualize frequency of sightings based on locations and average duration the UFO sightings.
